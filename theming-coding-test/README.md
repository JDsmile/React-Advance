# CSS Coding Test

The CSS Theming Coding Test is a way for you to demonstrate your strong UX and design sensibilities, while following pixel-perfect design specifications. PLEASE READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS BELOW BEFORE STARTING.

### The Task

You have been provided the below link to the desktop and mobile designs for a Clinique Single Product Page:

[https://www.figma.com/file/uN59FhzJ0X7OVrI5jGNXHi/CSS-Theming-Coding-Test?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/uN59FhzJ0X7OVrI5jGNXHi/CSS-Theming-Coding-Test?node-id=0%3A1)

Your task is to use HTML/CSS/SCSS, including the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology (https://en.bem.info/methodology/), to translate these specs into a pixel-perfext UI.

Specifically, you are styling all of the following React components found in the starter code:

- src/Product.js
- src/ProductImage.js
- src/ProductPurchase.js
- src/ProductDesc.js

DO NOT STYLE OR MAKE ANY EDITS TO THE MENU. The navigation menu (src/Menu.js) has already been styled and is not included in the test.

Additional Notes:

- THIS IS NOT A REACT/JAVASCRIPT CODING TEST. You should only need to use HTML/CSS/SCSS to accomplish this task.
- In the Figma design, click on Code and then CSS, (in the top right of the page) to view the dimensions for all elements.
- Feel free to add additional DOM elements as needed.
- All styles should be added to src/styles/product.scss, but feel free to create additional scss files as necessary.
- All font files have been included under src/fonts and can be found in src/styles/fonts.scss. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER FONTS.
- All necessary images and icons have been provided in the src/images folder. Feel free to re-export any images from Figma, but please use HTML/CSS/SCSS to style everything else.
- Please make sure your submission is responsive. DO NOT build a separate mobile and desktop version.
- Remember to use BEM!
